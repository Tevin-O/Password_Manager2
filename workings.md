## How the Secure Password Manager works

## Overview
The codebase consists of a secure password manager designed for a cryptography class. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manage passwords securely using cryptographic techniques. The main components of the codebase include the `Keychain` class, which handles password management, and various utility functions for cryptographic operations.

## Key Components

### 1. Keychain Class
The `Keychain` class is the core of the password manager. It provides methods for initializing the keychain, setting and retrieving passwords, and encrypting/decrypting data.

#### Constructor
- Initializes an empty key-value store (`kvs`) for storing domain-password pairs.
- Initializes `masterKey` and `salt` to null.

#### Key Derivation
- The `deriveKey` method derives a cryptographic key from the user's master password using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2).
- It uses a random salt to enhance security and performs a specified number of iterations (100,000) to make brute-force attacks more difficult.

#### Initialization
- The `init` method initializes the keychain with a master password. It generates a random salt and derives the master key from the password.

#### Loading State
- The `load` method allows loading a previously saved state of the keychain from a serialized representation. It verifies the integrity of the data using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) before decrypting the passwords.

#### Setting Passwords
- The `set` method encrypts a password for a given domain and stores it in the key-value store along with its HMAC for integrity verification.

#### Retrieving Passwords
- The `get` method retrieves the password for a specified domain. It verifies the HMAC before decrypting the password to ensure it has not been tampered with.

#### Removing Passwords
- The `remove` method deletes the password entry for a specified domain from the key-value store.

#### Encryption and Decryption
- The `encrypt` method uses AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode) to encrypt passwords. It generates a random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation.
- The `decrypt` method decrypts the encrypted password using the stored IV and the master key.

### 2. Cryptographic Utilities
The codebase includes several utility functions for handling cryptographic operations:
- `stringToBuffer`: Converts a string to an ArrayBuffer.
- `bufferToString`: Converts an ArrayBuffer back to a string.
- `encodeBuffer`: Encodes an ArrayBuffer to a base64 string for storage.
- `decodeBuffer`: Decodes a base64 string back to an ArrayBuffer.
- `getRandomBytes`: Generates a specified number of random bytes, used for salts and IVs.

### 3. Testing
The codebase includes a testing framework to ensure the functionality of the password manager. Tests are written to verify that:
- Passwords can be set and retrieved correctly.
- The integrity of the data is maintained through HMAC verification.
- Passwords can be encrypted and decrypted without loss of information.
- The keychain can be initialized and loaded from a serialized state.

### 4. Installation and Usage
To set up the password manager:
1. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Initialize the keychain with a master password:
   ```javascript
   const keychain = await Keychain.init('your_master_password');
   ```
3. Use the provided methods to set, get, and remove passwords.

### 5. Security Considerations
- The use of PBKDF2 with a high iteration count and random salts helps protect against brute-force attacks.
- HMAC ensures that any tampering with the stored data can be detected.
- AES-GCM provides both confidentiality and integrity for stored passwords.

### Conclusion
The password manager is a robust application that demonstrates the application of cryptographic principles in real-world scenarios. It provides users with a secure way to manage their passwords while ensuring that their sensitive information remains protected. The project serves as an educational tool for understanding the importance of security in software development and the implementation of cryptographic techniques.
